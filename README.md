## Blog
Its my first Rails project to learn:  

1. How to install Rails, create a new Rails application and connect the application to the database.
2. The general layout of a Rails application.  
3. The basic principles of MVC (Model, View, Controller) and RESTful design.    
4. How to quickly generate the starting pieces of a Rails application.

## Installations:  
To install Rails, use the gem install command provided by RubyGems:  
$ gem install rails  

Creating the Blog Application:  
$ rails new blog  

Starting up the Web Server:  
$ bin/rails server

To see your application in action:  
 Open a browser window and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should see the Rails default information page.
